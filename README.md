# elasticsearch_kibana_project


## Project description:

### üìä Log Analysis Dashboard (Mini-ELK)
**Dataset**: Sample [Apache](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnu0399/server-logs) or [Web Server](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eliasdabbas/web-server-access-logs) log files  

**Must-have**  
- Index logs with fields: timestamp, status code, IP, URL  
- Find all errors (`status >= 400`)  
- Search logs by URL pattern  

**Nice-to-have**  
- Aggregations: requests per status code, per hour, top IPs  
- Visualization in [Kibana](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kibana/index.htm) (time series or pie charts)  
- Alerting (simulated) for error spikes  


1 repository and your code and queries should follow **clean coding practices**:  
- Use meaningful variable names  
- Add docstrings to functions  
- Organize queries in reusable functions  
- Avoid hardcoding values unnecessarily  

### üåü Nice-to-Have
If you finish early or want to explore advanced features:  
- Implement **autocomplete** for search input  
- Use the **‚Äúdid you mean‚Äù** feature for misspelled queries  
- Add **advanced aggregations** (e.g., histograms, percentiles)  
- Visualize results in [Kibana](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kibana/index.htm) or a custom web UI  
- Try **vector search** if your dataset supports embeddings for similarity queries

## Structure of the repo





## Installation and set-up

The project is based on an [Apache sample](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnu0399/server-logs), downloaded from Kaggle. This is a synthetic server logs dataset based on Apache Server logs format.  
This dataset is stored in a 'data' folder.

**Components in Log Entry :**  
- IP of client: This refers to the IP address of the client that sent the request to the server.
Remote Log Name: Remote name of the User performing the request. In the majority of the applications, this is confidential information and is hidden or not available.  
- User ID: The ID of the user performing the request. In the majority of the applications, this is a piece of confidential information and is hidden or not available.  
- Date and Time in UTC format: The date and time of the request are represented in UTC format as follows: Day/Month/Year:Hour:Minutes: Seconds +Time-Zone-Correction. 
- Request Type: The type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that the server got. This depends on the operation that the request will do.  
- API: The API of the website to which the request is related. Example: When a user accesses a carton shopping website, the API comes as /usr/cart.  
- Protocol and Version: Protocol used for connecting with server and its version.  
- Status Code: Status code that the server returned for the request. Eg: 404 is sent when a requested resource is not found. 200 is sent when the request was successfully served.  
- Byte: The amount of data in bytes that was sent back to the client.  
- Referrer: The websites/source from where the user was directed to the current website. If none it is represented by ‚Äú-‚Äú.  
- UA String: The user agent string contains details of the browser and the host device (like the name, version, device type etc.).  
- Response Time: The response time the server took to serve the request. This is the difference between the timestamps when the request was received and when the request was served.
